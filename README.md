# Taxamo Python bindings

    python setup.py install

## Documentation

Please see http://www.taxamo.com/documentation/ for the most up-to-date documentation.

## Testing

We commit to being compatible with Python 2.6+, Python 3.1+ and PyPy.  We need to test against all of these environments to ensure compatibility.  Travis CI will automatically run our tests on push.  
For local testing, we use [tox](http://tox.readthedocs.org/) to handle testing across environments.
